* Syntax of Program
E := n              (n is integer)
     x              (x is string)
     {e1 + e2}
     {e1 - e2}
B := {x <= n}       (true if x is less than n)
     {x >= n}       (true if x is greater than n)
     {true}
     {false}
C := {skip}         (skip)
     {c1 ; c2}      (run c1 and c2)
     {x := E}       (assign value of E to x)
     {Input x}      (Get user input and store it to x)
     {If B c1 c2}   (if B is true, than run c1. Else run c2)
     {While B C}    (run c multiple time until B becomes false)
     {Goto E}       (move program counter to label E)
* Syntax of Condition
V := n              (n is integer)
     inf            (Infinity. It is negative when it goes left, positive when it goes right of interval)
M := x=[v1,v2]      (map interval abstraction [v1,v2] to variable x)
A := {M}            (set of mapping. separated by comma)
     bottom         (bottom abstraction)
* How to use function 'run'
It gets two String arguments. First one is program and second one is pre-condition
Example
  run("{skip}", "{}")
  run("{z := 1}", "{x=[1,2],y=[inf,0]}")
  run("{If {x <= 0} {z := {x + 2}} {{x := {x - 1}}; {z := {x + y}}}}", "{x=[1,2],y=[3,4],a=[inf,inf]}")
